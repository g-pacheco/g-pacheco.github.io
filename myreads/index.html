<blockquote>
I read quite a few <i>Science Communication</i> books throughout my bachelor times in Natal. Undoubtedly, titles such as <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2272880.The_Drunkard_s_Walk?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=uqKSUezXLV&rank=1" target="_blank"><i>The Drunkard's Walk</i></a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182868.Lonely_Planets?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=DBzTgWO9sV&rank=3" target="_blank"><i>Lonely Planets</i></a> greatly contributed to my initial scientic education. Although I still very much harbour a desire to read on various scientific subjects (I really like <i>Physics</i>, for instance), at some point one must focus on a specific field considering the short half-life of a human begin, and thus my reading of this kind of genre is no longer as diverse as it once was. Moreoever, by the end of my PhD in Copenhagen, I became rather interested in <i>Literature</i>, and I have been trying to catch up reading the <i>Classics</i>. Should you be curious to see which books I have read on these fronts, you are welcome to check my profile on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/91609313-george-pacheco?utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&ref=nav_mybooks&title=george-pacheco&sort=date_added&order=d&per_page=100" target="_blank">goodreads</a>.
</blockquote>
</p>
<blockquote>
Having said that, what I present below is a list of titles revolving round the two subjects I intend to expertise, namely <i>Evolutionary Biology</i> & <i>Philosophy of Science</i>. The books I have already read (at least once) are marked in green, and a short commentary is provided. Please acknowledge that this is for my own personal recording, and my impressions on these titles should be taken with care. Else, I have decided to list them in a chronological order because I find it revealing to realise how things unfolded historically. For instance, Huxley published his book on the evolution of <i>Homo sapiens</i> 8 years before Darwin presented his own work on this subject; or that Wallaced published his book on <i>Natural Selection</i> 20 years after Darwin's famous title had been published.
