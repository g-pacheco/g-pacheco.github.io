<b>16 Jul 2023/</b> After being in the Chokpak region (Kazakhstan) helping in the sampling live sparrows, I spent a few days visiting the Avian Section of the British Natural Museum in Tring to study their sparrow collection. I am now back to Oslo where I have started to analyse our incipient genomic data. It is great to be in Scandinavia during the remaining summer period. Nonetheless, the winter is coming — and I am inevitably reminded of seeds and their locations. 🥶 🌨️ ⛄ I should stop conversing with the old wizard from the South.

<b>08-10 Feb 2023/</b> During this week, I attended my very first conference in Norway: <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/research/news/events/research/other/2023/norwegian-biodiversity-genomics-conference.html" target="_blank"><i>Norwegian Biodiversity & Genomics Conference</i></a>. It was a great pleasure to network with both local and international peers working on <i>Genomics</i>. Reflecting upon everything that was discussed, I am left with the impression that the current state of the field with so many consortia and a sheer amount of data being generated is similar to that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field" target="_blank">Hubble Deep Field</a> — we do not really know what this exposure will reveal, but it is still worth collectiong the data. 📊 📈 🗣️

I really liked the structure of the conference because it was devoted to MSc and PhD students providing thus the young generation with a great opportunity to present their work. It was also nice to visit Oslo and I am looking forward to the commencement of my 3-year post-doc position at <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/" target="_blank"><i>CEES</i></a> where I will be working on <i>Sparrow Genomics</i>. 🐦 🧬 💻
